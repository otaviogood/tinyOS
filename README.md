# Tiny Quest / Tiny OS
A bunch of video games and apps for small kids

### License?
I'd like to make all the code public domain. Not sure how that works since there are SVG images mixed in there that have other licenses. I got many of the SVG images from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and [freepik](https://freepik.com/) and I paid the fee, so it should be attribution-free, but not public domain. Anyway, so consider the code public domain except for inlined-images and other images and sound files.

### Get it running
